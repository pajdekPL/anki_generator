### ANKI:
"Anki is a free and open-source flashcard program using spaced repetition, 
a technique from cognitive science for memorization. 
The name comes from the Japanese word for "memorization". 
The SM-2 algorithm, created for SuperMemo in the late 1980s, 
forms the basis of the spaced repetition methods employed in the program." Wikipedia
